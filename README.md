# Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis
Perform exploratory data analysis and feature engineering and then apply feature engineering. Follow up with a deep learning model to predict whether or not the loan will be default using the historical data.

Tasks:

1.     Feature Transformation

Transform categorical values into numerical values (discrete)

2.     Exploratory data analysis of different factors of the dataset.

3.     Additional Feature Engineering

You will check the correlation between features and will drop those features which have a strong correlation

This will help reduce the number of features and will leave you with the most relevant features

4.     Modeling

After applying EDA and feature engineering, you are now ready to build the predictive models

In this part, you will create a deep learning model using Keras with Tensorflow backend
